  ### What Was Done

  **Digital Midstream™ Explainer Blog Post:**
  - Created comprehensive 12-minute read explaining the full Digital Midstream™ process
  - Includes 10 detailed image prompts for Claude Desktop to render visual diagrams:
    1. Hero Diagram - Problem/Solution overview
    2. Economic Comparison - Traditional vs Digital Midstream
    3. Site Assessment Process Flow
    4. Generator Infrastructure Detail
    5. Compute Options - Bitcoin Mining vs AI Inference
    6. Revenue Flow Diagram (Sankey-style)
    7. Complete Site Layout - Aerial/Plan View
    8. Data Connectivity Options
    9. Emissions Reduction Comparison
    10. Technology Stack Diagram
  - Technical specs sourced from `/srv/projects/og-ai-inference-research/docs/PRD.md`
  - Added to blogPosts array with id=6, slug `what-is-digital-midstream`

  **Internal Linking Implementation:**
  - Added Related Articles section to DigitalMidstream.tsx (links to 3 relevant blog posts)
  - Added Related Articles section to BlogPost.tsx (shows 3 other posts dynamically)
  - Added Service Link Banner to BlogPost.tsx (links to Digital Midstream service page)
  - Added "Read our complete guide" link to About.tsx (links to explainer blog post)
  - Fixed Services.tsx href: `/services/data-center-operations` → `/services/data-center-ops`

  **SEO Updates:**
  - Added all 6 blog post URLs to sitemap.xml with appropriate priorities
  - New explainer post given priority 0.8 (high value content)

  ### Files Changed

  #### Created
  - `src/pages/BlogPost.tsx` - Blog post detail page with 6 article contents and image prompts

  #### Modified
  - `src/pages/Blog.tsx` - Added new blog post entry (id=6)
  - `src/pages/DigitalMidstream.tsx` - Added Related Articles section with 3 blog links
  - `src/components/About.tsx` - Added "Read our complete guide" blog link
  - `src/components/Services.tsx` - Fixed data-center-ops href
  - `public/sitemap.xml` - Added all 6 blog post URLs

  ### Context & Decisions

  **Image prompt approach:**
  - Each prompt is self-contained with explicit style directions
  - All use industrial color palette with orange (#E36414) accents
  - 16:9 aspect ratio for web consistency
  - Designed for Claude Desktop artifact rendering

  **Internal linking strategy:**
  - Service pages → related blog posts
  - Blog posts → other posts + main service page
  - About section → flagship explainer content
  - Creates topical clusters for SEO

  ### Unfinished Work

  - [ ] Generate actual images from the 10 Claude Desktop prompts
  - [ ] Replace placeholder image boxes with rendered graphics
  - [ ] Consider adding images to other blog posts

  ### Notes for Next Agent

  1. **Images not generated yet** - The 10 image prompts in the blog post are styled placeholder boxes. Copy the prompts to Claude Desktop to generate the actual graphics.

  2. **Build passes** - All changes compile successfully.

  3. **Already pushed** - Commit fe80106 is on origin/main.

  4. **Blog post structure:**
     - Metadata in `src/pages/Blog.tsx` blogPosts array
     - Content JSX in `src/pages/BlogPost.tsx` blogContent object
     - URL in `public/sitemap.xml`

  5. **Legacy devlog exists** - `docs/DEVLOG.md` contains previous session history. Migration script had syntax issues. Consider manual migration or keeping both formats.
