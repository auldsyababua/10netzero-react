## Competitor Segmentation

### Scale vs Value Proposition

**Key Observations:**
1. Competitors solve one or more value propositions at different scales
2. Most competitors are ESG/flare mitigation focused
3. Competitor business models are typically single project opportunities
4. Scaling is typically done by geographic/location diversification

### Value Propositions in Market:
- Midstream Replacement
- ESG KPIs
- Depressed NG Markets
- Emissions Reduction
- Reliable Flow Assurance
- Diversification
- Non-routine Flaring
- Short-term Flare Mitigation
- Pilot Projects
- Flare Intensity Reduction
- Stranded Gas Flare Mitigation

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- **Crusoe**: Well funded, well known, large network and experience. Industry leader.
- **NGON**: Well funded, has experience, partnered with a large public miner.
- **360 Energy**: Partnership with Haliburton. Good market reach.
- **10NetZero**: Best business model → best value proposition fit with Digital Midstream. High quality, high volume, low-cost natural gas, strategic partner for low-risk scaling, multi-discipline hands-on experience from top down. Low-cost leader.

### Weaknesses
- **Crusoe**: Lost IP challenge, pivoting away from off-grid datacenters.
- **NGON**: Business model is not ideal for scaling and being as efficient as possible. Value Proposition is limited.
- **360 Energy**: Lack operational experience and access to capital. Do not own equipment and dependent on third-party services.
- **10NetZero**: Needs capital to execute business model.

### Opportunities
- **Crusoe**: Leveraging existing capacity and network
- **NGON**: Leverage partnership to raise money, grab market share in off-grid data center market. Synergies with operations from public miner.
- **360 Energy**: Leverage relationship with Haliburton to scale and grow market share, access to tier-1 oil and gas operators.
- **10NetZero**: Become the largest off-grid data center company with lowest cost leadership and lowest risk. First mover advantage with Digital Midstream business model.

### Threats
- **Crusoe**: Lost IP challenge, could not be allowed to develop or leverage existing traditional off-grid data centers. (Update: settled – have license).
- **NGON**: Business model is not easy to scale, could not fulfill 25MW goal with public miner, lose market share or not be able to be low-cost leader.
- **360 Mining**: Profitability could be low, hard to scale unless tier-1 operators buy-in and build their own off-grid data centers. Rental model loses market share.
- **10NetZero**: Unable to raise capital and deploy Digital Midstream business model before someone else does, lose first mover advantage and market share.
