## Phase 1: The Company Brain

**Our Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**

All business data—from field operations to financial records—flows automatically into one central, intelligent Supabase repository. This brain becomes the foundation for all future insights, automation, and AI.

**Data Sources:**
- **Comms**: Slack/Telegram channels and email streams
- **Telemetry**: Foreman, SCADA, Live Weather
- **Financials**: ERP system transactions
- **Field Ops**: Reports from crews

**Lean Foundation Built:**
- Problem Identified: Knowledge scattered, high-friction task management
- Solution Deployed: MVP on Supabase + OpenProject self-hosted
- Breakthrough Achieved: Frictionless Telegram Bot API for 100% data capture
- Capital Efficiency: Total infrastructure cost: $25/month

---

## Phase 2: The Workers - Smart Agents Activation

### SiteGPT
The AI Oracle for every mining site. It instantly answers technical questions using all site-specific documents and live data + a corpus of general knowledge useful for team members when troubleshooting or integrating.

### Talk2Comms
Talk to your chat history and easily find that comment made by the field team leader about Genny A at Eagle Lake or create rich timelines with sources, all on-the-fly for use in insurance claims, lawsuits, demands, or just situational awareness. Team members are no longer delayed while performing admin tasks that waste time.

### FLRTS NLP
Frictionless Field Operations & Tasking. This NLP layer enables field staff to create Field Reports, Lists, Reminders, and Tasks from simple Telegram messages, translating natural language into structured items for our central project management system.

## Phase 3: The Nervous System - Project Pythia Moat

- **Goal**: 97%+ Uptime via ML-powered equipment failure prediction
- **Strategic JV Partner**: Joint Venture with Digital Carpenters
- **Hybrid Financial Model**: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee → Revenue-Share transition

**Two-Phase Approach:**
1. **Development**: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee model guarantees delivery
2. **Commercialization**: Revenue-Share creates long-term growth alignment

---

## Phase 4: The Moonshot - Off-Grid AI Inference

Our long-term strategy focuses on three key areas:
1. Leveraging our off-grid power to build a distributed AI compute network, ensuring resilience and scalability.
2. Diversifying our revenue stream beyond cryptocurrency market volatility, creating a more stable business model.
3. Becoming a first mover in the emerging market for low-cost, distributed AI compute, setting industry standards.

### Technical Plan: Power Smoothing

**Variable Power Input** → **BESS Buffer** → **Stable Power Output for AI**

- Cat NG Generator requires stable load
- Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) acts as critical buffer
- Result: precisely regulated power supply for AI inference

## The Flywheel Effect

Superior Operations → Attract Partners → Gain Data → Smarter AI → (repeat)

**First Mover = Data Moat**

> We must act now

## Proactive AI Governance

**Safety as Core Design Principle**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Prompt Injection | Security middleware and minute-by-minute snapshots |
| Data Poisoning | Robust validation pipelines |
| Mesa-Optimization | Human-in-the-loop oversight & monitoring |

> Robust governance = competitive advantage

## The Ask: Fueling Growth

**Total Request: $2.63M + 1% in BigSur vested over a year**

### Core Intelligence Platform (3-Year Budget: $761,580)
- Senior developer: $236,250/year
- JV partnership: $50,000

### Off-Grid AI Inference R&D (2-Year Initial: $1,870,710)
- NVIDIA DGX H100: $450k
- 1 MW / 2 MWh BESS: $450k

## Risk Assessment

**$3,350 Daily Opportunity Cost** - Foregone Bitcoin mining profits at current rates

### Strategic Risk Mitigation
1. **Hedge Against Crypto Volatility**: Distributed AI compute offers larger, stable market
2. **Start Small with Test/Dev Cluster**: Prove concept before full-scale commitment
3. **Explore GPU Hardware Leasing**: Reduce CapEx and protect against obsolescence

## Building the Machine That Builds the Machine

- Foundation Built: Core systems operational
- De-risked Plan: Phased approach with clear milestones
- Competitive Moat: Clear path to unbeatable advantage
