    {
      "question": "What is Digital Midstream?",
      "answer": "Digital Midstream is 10NetZero's flagship solution that converts stranded natural gas into electricity and digital assets (like Bitcoin) directly at the wellsite. Unlike traditional midstream infrastructure (pipelines), it's modular, mobile, and requires zero capital investment from operators."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to get started with 10NetZero?",
      "answer": "$0 upfront. 10NetZero handles all infrastructure, equipment, installation, and ongoing operations. Operators simply provide access to their stranded gas and receive a share of the generated revenue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can 10NetZero handle sour gas with H2S?",
      "answer": "Yes. 10NetZero specializes in treating H2S-contaminated gas that other providers cannot handle. This expands the addressable market to wells that would otherwise have no monetization options."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can equipment be deployed?",
      "answer": "Modular infrastructure can be deployed and operational within 2-4 weeks. This compares to years for traditional pipeline construction projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when gas production declines?",
      "answer": "Because the infrastructure is modular and mobile, equipment can be redeployed to other sites as production declines. This eliminates stranded asset risk that comes with fixed pipeline infrastructure."
